# NAIROBI HOSPITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM TEST

###### By Bradley Agwa

## Description
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following: 

i. Provide insight on the data set through exploratory data analysis.

ii. Create a multiple classification models to predict an individual's hypothyroid status based on the available information. The models include: Decision Trees

Random Forest Classification Model
Ada Boosted Classification Model
Gradient Boosted Classification Model
Support Vector Machine

Support Classification Model(Linear kernel)
Support Classification Model(Polynomial kernel)
Support Classification Model(Sigmoid kernel)
Support Classification Model(RBF kernel)
iii. Identify the key factors in predicting a patient's hypothyroid status.
